## Hi there 👋

My name is Ethan Roos, and I'm an aspiring software engineer.

I graduated with my B.S and M.S in computer science from UC Riverside, and I'm currently looking for software engineering roles.
I love working on systems projects, and pretty much anything else where I get to challenge myself and learn new things.

I recently deployed [cworkbench.dev](https://cworkbench.dev), which is a web interface for a C compiler I wrote from scratch. Feel free to check it out!

### Contact

I'm always happy to answer questions. If you have any correspondence, feel free to reach out to me via email at eroos101@gmail.com.
